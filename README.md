# I am absolutely clueless what to write here

But anyways, Astherive Genesis is a lore-prequel to the original mod, Astherive, which is also appears to be made by me somehow...
Well, currently it is extremely...like extreme extradionary ultra unfinished.

Some crazy delusional goals may include:
- Bioplasm, a recreation of the long-awaited neoplasm. hell yeah
- Complete 20 playable sectors
- Absolutely massive star system for no reason

# Current progress

Bioplasm is working, roots, bridges, drills, items complete.
Player content is still somewhat sparse, not playable yet
